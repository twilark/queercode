**Custom emoji shortcodes for Obsidian**, styled for visibility, fun, and flair.

This plugin lets you use shortcodes like `:blue_potion:` or `:furry_pride:` directly in Obsidian notes. These render as inline emoji PNGs or SVGs, styled to look good in normal text, headers, callouts, and tables.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Who is this for?**
>
> - Obsidian users who value colorful emoji in their visual hierarchy and notetaking,
> - Who are constrained by their device's ability to display specific Unicode characters cleanly within Obsidian (i.e. stubborn Win10 users ðŸ’œ)
> - And/or who are unsatisfied with Twemoji-as-default, or the shortcodes imposed by e.g. Iconic

## âœ¨ Features

- Define and use custom emoji with easy `:shortcode:` syntaxâ€”no special commands
- Autocomplete suggestions activate as you type shortcodes (e.g., type `:f` to see all matches with previews, and insert `:furry_pride:` at your cursor)
- Preferred filetype selection when emojis exist as both PNG and SVG
- Auto-generated emoji map from your emoji image folder
- Consistent styling everywhere
- Supports `.png` and `.svg` emoji images

## ðŸ›  Adding New Emojis

1. Drop PNGs into `data/emojis/`.
2. Run:

```bash
npm run generate-emoji-map
```

3. Use shortcodes like `:file_name:` in your notes.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Your images **must** be `.png` or `.svg` format.
- Filenames become shortcodes automatically: bisexual_flag.png`â†’`:bisexual_flag:` Autocomplete triggers only after typing at least one character after`:`.
- These shortcodes can be safely changed, but user is responsible for ensuring unique entries.
- Existing entries in `emoji-map.json` won't be overwritten. If you've changed a mapped emoji, it should not overwrite.
- **Not all emojis are covered, and some will never be.** Please see Mutant Standard documentation.

- [ ] Fix HTML parse edge cases (e.g. some `span` nesting gets eaten)
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search/autocomplete for easier lookup
- [ ] Add emoji hover titles for accessibility
- [ ] Support combined emoji+label syntax (e.g., `:emoji::label:`)
- [ ] Optional fallback behavior if emoji image is missing
