**Custom emoji shortcodes for Obsidian**, styled for visibility, fun, and flair.

This plugin lets you use shortcodes like `:blue_potion:` or `:furry_pride:` directly in Obsidian notes. These render as inline emoji PNGs or SVGs, styled to look good in normal text, headers, callouts, and tables.

> [!NOTE]
> **Who is this for?**
>
> - Obsidian users who value colorful emoji in their visual hierarchy and notetaking,
> - Who are constrained by their device's ability to display specific Unicode characters cleanly within Obsidian (i.e. stubborn Win10 users ðŸ’œ)
> - And/or who are unsatisfied with Twemoji-as-default, or the shortcodes imposed by e.g. Iconic

## ðŸ›  Adding New Emojis

1. Drop PNGs into `queercode/emojis/`.
2. Run:

```bash
npm run generate-emoji-map
```

3. Use shortcodes like `:file_name:` in your notes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Your images **must** be `.png` or `.svg` format
- Filenames become shortcodes automatically: `bisexual_flag.png` â†’ `:bisexual_flag:` Autocomplete triggers only after typing at least one character after `:`
- These shortcodes can be safely changed, but user is responsible for ensuring unique entries
- Emoji rendering in Live Preview modes is not always predictable
- Custom entries in `emoji-map.json` should not be overwritten even if the map must be regenerated
- **Not all emojis are covered, and some will never be.** Please see Mutant Standard documentation for more information

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] Generate and control `emoji-map.json` from plugin settings GUI in Obsidian
- [ ] Significantly improve stability of rendering in Live Preview
- [ ] Refactor for maintainability + testing
- [ ] Toggle plugin context (e.x.: restrict within codeblocks) for suggester and renderers
- [ ] Skintone & hand part default/fallback selection for humanoid emojis during map generation
- [ ] Drag-and-drop UI for managing multiple asset packs
- [ ] Combined emoji+modifier syntax (e.g., `:emoji::modifier:`) to apply dynamic, inline styling/behaviors
- [ ] Support `.gif` and `.webp` files
