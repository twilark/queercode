## 0.6.3-alpha (Latest)

- **ðŸš€ CM6 Integration:** Plugin now renders emoji in live preview! CM6 integration across nearly all contexts.
  - Now uses CM6's `decorations.map(update.changes)`; full rebuild only occurs when user types exiting `:`, drastically reducing potential for lag.
  - `TreeWalker` hybrid approach eliminated, DOM stability restored. Document no longer vanishes on mode switch.
  - `EmojiWidget.ts` now has a more intelligent `ignoreEvent` method that allows seamless keyboard navigation and pass-through, while blocking mouse-clicks that caused unreliable cursor behavior.
  - CSS rule (`cursor: text;`) to complement widget stability in text flow.
- **Known Issues:** Emojis render inside of fenced and inline codeblocks.
- **Todo:**
  - Implement robust context handling through `syntaxTree` (including helper function in `LivePreview.ts`) that will check node type before scanning for emojis. This is far more reliable than regex, and permits user control toggling.
  - Code cleanup: Remove unnecessary files; centralize `TreeWalker` logic in `ShortcodeDecorator.ts` (and import elsewhere).

0.6.2-alpha: reverted keymap handlers to attempt to address cursor handling issues
0.6.1-alpha: temporarily fixed context rendering... which broke DOM sync
0.6.0-alpha: CM6 decoration implemented in `LivePreview.ts`, with cursor issues and improper context rendering
0.5.8-alpha: separation of concerns + modularity, generate emoji map from settings GUI
0.5.5-alpha: - generate `emoji-map` from GUI is now much improved; - map generation is recursive and accounts for subdirectories; - filepath handling is now (should be) consistent across modules
0.5.3-alpha: un-broke images in suggester (inconsistent filepaths in `EmojiSuggest.ts` and `main.ts` constructor)
0.5.2-alpha: - circular dependencies squashed. - map generation now appropriately falls back to plugin asset folder if custom path is not provided.
0.5.1-alpha: user may define asset library path - (this introduced circular dependencies and known filepath handling issues across multiple components resulting in negative behavioral impact).
0.5.0-alpha: plugin is now more modular, with logic split into 5 main files (`main.ts`, `SettingsTab.ts`, `MapHandler.ts`, `EmojiService.ts`, and `EmojiSuggest.ts`) plus `emoji-map.json`.
0.4.6-alpha: in `suggest.ts`, replacement now detects closing `:` and correctly replaces existing shortcode.
0.4.5-alpha: suggester and callouts now work as expected. - suggestions should now appear when `:` is preceeded by markdown formatting characters (regex tweaks in `main.ts` and `suggest.ts`); - fixed logic that caused rendering emoji on alternate lines within callouts to fail (Treewalker now appropriately handles node siblings disrupted by `<br>`).
0.4.0-alpha: - fixed nested span rendering which caused in-callout rendering to fail; - autocomplete within tables now functions as expected instead of duplicating and appending partial shortcodes.
0.3.0-alpha: added suggestion + autocomplete (EditorSuggest class, fuzzysort)
0.2.5-alpha: added .svg support
0.2.0-alpha: cleanup file structure and plugin logic, smarter and less destructive emoji-map generation
0.1.0-alpha: initial commit; DOM injection + mutation for basic nodes (body, headers)
