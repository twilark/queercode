0.4.5-alpha: adjusted regex in main.ts and suggest.ts; suggestions should appear when `:` is preceded by MD formatting characters; TreeWalker now appropriately handles node siblings disrupted by `<br>`. suggester and callouts now work as expected
0.4.0-alpha: fixed (most) nested span rendering and injection; autocomplete in tables now functions (and renders) as expected
0.3.0-alpha: added suggestion + autocomplete (EditorSuggest class, fuzzysort)
0.2.5-alpha: add .svg support
0.2.0-alpha: cleanup file structure and plugin logic, smarter and less destructive emoji-map generation
0.1.0-alpha: initial commit; DOM injection for basic nodes
