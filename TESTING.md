# Testing the SMART TIMING CM6 Implementation

## Root Cause Analysis & REAL Solution ‚úÖ

**Real Problem**: Rebuilding decorations on EVERY keystroke caused cursor conflicts during active typing.

**Real Solution**: Smart timing that only rebuilds decorations when it actually makes sense:
- ‚úÖ When shortcode is completed (`:emoji:`)
- ‚úÖ When text is deleted (might affect existing decorations) 
- ‚úÖ When large text chunks are inserted
- ‚ùå NOT on every single keystroke while typing

**Key Insight**: The issue wasn't the contexts (headers, lists, etc.) - it was rebuilding decorations at the wrong times!

## Quick Install for Testing

1. **Copy the plugin files** to your Obsidian vault's plugin directory:
   ```
   cp main.js manifest.json styles.css /path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins/queercode/
   ```

2. **Enable the plugin** in Obsidian Settings > Community Plugins > Queercode

3. **Generate emoji map** in plugin settings (or copy existing emoji-map.json)

## Smart Timing Approach Implemented:

### üß† **Intelligent Rebuild Detection**:
- **Shortcode completion**: Immediate rebuild when `:emoji:` is typed
- **Text deletion**: Quick rebuild when text is deleted
- **Large insertions**: Rebuild on paste or multi-character input
- **Near decorations**: Rebuild when typing near existing emojis
- **Single keystrokes**: NO rebuild (prevents cursor conflicts)

### ‚ö° **Dynamic Timing**:
- **50ms delay** for shortcode completion (immediate feedback)
- **200ms delay** for other changes (batch rapid typing)
- **Cursor safety zone** - no decorations within 3 characters of cursor

### üéØ **Full Functionality Restored**:
‚úÖ **ALL contexts work again**:
- Headers: `# Header :100: text` 
- Lists: `- Item :100: emoji`
- Blockquotes: `> Quote :100: text`
- Normal paragraphs: `Text :100: more text`
- Hashtags with spacing: `#tag :100:`

‚ùå **Still properly blocked**:
- Code contexts: `` `code :100:` `` and ``` blocks
- Hashtag merging: `#tag:100:` (no space)
- Table rows: `| cell :100: |`

### Testing Instructions:

1. Open `test-emoji.md` in Live Preview mode
2. Test each scenario listed in the file
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Cursor behavior when typing `#` followed by shortcuts
   - Arrow key movement before/after emoji decorations
   - Backspace behavior on emoji decorations
   - Whether hashtags like `#test:100:` correctly avoid rendering

### Known Limitations:

- Still uses line-by-line approach (syntax tree was reverted due to previous issues)
- Complex nested contexts may still have edge cases
- Performance could be optimized further with more sophisticated change detection

## Reporting Issues

If you find issues, please test specifically:
1. What you typed
2. Where the cursor was positioned
3. What unexpected behavior occurred
4. Whether it's reproducible
